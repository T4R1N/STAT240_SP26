# STAT240_SP26
This is the central repository where students of STAT 240 in Spring 2026 can access course files, including discussion and homework assignments. This repository will be updated continually throughout the semester with new assignments, solutions, and other files.

It is important that the STAT 240 files on your own computer are organized in exactly the same was as the files and folders on Github!  That way, you will be able to successfully read files into Rstudio when working through lecture handouts, discussions, or homework assignments.
